Editor's Checklist
=================

A WordPress Plugin
------------------

This WordPress plugin hides the 'Publish' button on the Edit Post page unless certain fields are completed, such as Headline, Excerpt, and Featured image. Users can set which fields are required in Settings > Editor's Checklist Options. 

A user will see checkboxes in their Publish meta box, and the 'Publish' button is hidden unless all fields are filled in.

As each field is filled in, the boxes will automatically check. Once all boxes are checked, the 'Publish' button appears.
